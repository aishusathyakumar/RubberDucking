as of now data folder includes the backend function not including any mongo Querying functions

routesis empty and should be kept empty till we have all the functions up and running

views is a set of html pages that will be used for the front end, someone will have to take over that

once we have all of this, 
we will be adding a folder called site, while will have a file named style.css and then we will have to change all thhe html poages to handlebars
and use the node package Handlebars, as npm install handlebars, for the server to shoot when we say npm start and open the pages in the browser
